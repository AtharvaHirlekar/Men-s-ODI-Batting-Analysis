## **ODI Batting Analysis Project**

## Overview

This Python project is designed for the analysis of One Day International (ODI) cricket batting statistics. It involves web scraping data from ESPNCricinfo to gather a comprehensive dataset of ODI batting performance. The analysis includes various aspects such as a player's career statistics, performance in World Cup tournaments, bowlers with the most dismissals against a specific batter, and data visualization using line charts and bar charts to depict various statistics.

Calculates career statistics, including the number of matches, runs scored, average, strike rate, centuries, half-centuries, and highest score.
Analyzes World Cup statistics, providing insights into a player's performance in this prestigious tournament.
Identifies bowlers who have dismissed a particular batter the most.
